//! # Useful Things Person Sensor
//!
//! A small driver for the Useful Things Person Sensor.
//!
//! Original [developer guide](https://usfl.ink/ps_dev)
//!
//! This driver has been tested with v1.1 of the sensor, but should also work with v1 and v2.
//! If you're able to validate the other board revisions, please open a pr to update this message :)
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The sensor offers two modes: continuous and single shot.
//! It can be converted between the two modes, and the compiler will prevent you from misusing
//! functionality that is only available in a specific mode, or when an interrupt pin is provided.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use person_sensor::PersonSensorBuilder;
//!
//! let i2c = /* ... */;
//! let interrupt_pin = /* ... */;
//!
//! // The driver can be initialized with or without the interrupt pin using the builder
//! let mut person_sensor = PersonSensorBuilder::new_standby(i2c)
//!     .with_interrupt(interrupt_pin) // optional
//!     .build()
//!     .await
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! let detections = person_sensor.capture_once().await.unwrap();
//!
//! // ERROR: an interrupt pin was provided, but person_sensor is in standby mode
//! // person_sensor.wait_for_person().await.unwrap();
//!
//! // To use the functionality in continuous mode, convert the sensor like below,
//! // or use the builder with new_continuous(...)
//! let mut person_sensor = sensor.into_continuous_mode();
//!
//! // Now we meet all the requirements to wait for the next detection using the interrupt
//! _ = person_sensor.wait_for_person().await.unwrap();
//! // Read the latest detections.
//! // Note wait_for_person() does not automatically read the detections
//! let detections = person_sensor.get_detections().await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! To run the examples on a pi pico, it should be sufficient to enter bootloader mode and run:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cd examples
//! cargo run --bin <example_name> --release
//! ```
